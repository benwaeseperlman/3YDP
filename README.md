This is our repo for our 3rd year design project robot.

It will autonomously drive a sprial course and traverse sand, stone and pit traps.

There was also a tie in report to the Canadian Engineering Grand Challenges (CEGC).

Project managment is done in ClickUp and CAD files stored in a GrabCAD repo.
